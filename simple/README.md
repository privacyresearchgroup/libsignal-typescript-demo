# Demo React Application using the libsignal-protocol-typescript

This simple web application demonstrates basic usage of the [Signal Typescript SDK](https://github.com/privacyresearchgroup/libsignal-protocol-typescript).
The application has two agents who register with a directory service, create a Signal Protocol session, and send encrypted messages. The application describes these steps, with reference to the source code, as you use it. The source code itself is a starting point for your own Signal Protocol application.

For an example of what server components are needed to support Signal Protocol messaging, look at this [serverless backend](https://github.com/privacyresearchgroup/signal-demo-backend).

Play with it online [here](https://signal-demo.privacyresearch.io/).
